/**
 * Peripheral interface for memory-mapped devices in 6502 systems.
 *
 * Peripherals are memory-mapped devices that respond to specific address ranges
 * within the 64KB address space. They can perform I/O operations, run periodic
 * updates, and generate hardware interrupts.
 *
 * All peripherals must declare their address boundaries to enable:
 * - Memory map validation and conflict detection
 * - System documentation and debugging
 * - Proper bus routing decisions
 *
 * Address Space Rules:
 * - Each peripheral must occupy a contiguous address range
 * - Address ranges should not overlap with other peripherals or memory
 * - Both start and end addresses are inclusive
 * - Address ranges can be anywhere in the 64KB space (0x0000-0xFFFF)
 * - Zero page (0x0000-0x00FF) is allowed for peripherals
