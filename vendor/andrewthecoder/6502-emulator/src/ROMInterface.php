/**
 * Interface for read-only memory implementations in 6502 systems.
 *
 * Defines the contract for ROM components used across different 6502-based
 * systems. ROM implementations may include BIOS, kernel, BASIC interpreters,
 * or other built-in programs.
 *
 * ROM is typically memory-mapped to the upper address space (e.g., $8000-$FFFF)
 * and contains the reset/interrupt vectors at $FFFA-$FFFF:
 * - $FFFA-$FFFB: NMI vector (Non-Maskable Interrupt)
 * - $FFFC-$FFFD: RESET vector (Power-on/reset entry point)
 * - $FFFE-$FFFF: IRQ/BRK vector (Maskable interrupt/break)
 *
 * ROM models physical hardware and loads data from binary files. For testing
 * with programmatic data, use SimpleBus or mock implementations instead.
 *
 * Address Space Rules:
 * - Each ROM must declare its address boundaries via getStartAddress/getEndAddress
 * - Address ranges must not overlap with other ROM, RAM, or peripherals
 * - ROM addresses are read-only from the CPU's perspective
 * - Address ranges can be anywhere in the 64KB space (0x0000-0xFFFF)
